      <h2>Welcome to Let's Travel the World</h2>
        <p>By traveling - both within the USA and abroad - we expand our horizons and gain a greater appreciation of the world we live in.
      <br>
        <p>Experiencing other cultures, including new food, languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us better understand our own culture.  
      <br>
        <p>We are a full service travel agency. As seasoned travelers ourselves, we know what we're talking about and can draw upon our own experiences when putting together a great adventure for you and your family.
      <br>
        <p>Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips ahead! Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get out the color pushpins...  
      <br>
        <p>So contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!
